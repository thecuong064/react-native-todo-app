# React Native Todo App

Simple todo app using React Native.
- Tasks are sorted by **priority** and **due time** (higher priority and nearer time will be placed on top).
- Adding a new task will **automatically generate** the default one with some initial properties (can be adjusted in src/constants/DefaultValues.js)
- **No cancel/undo behavior** is provided yet if users make some mistakes when modifying the tasks.
- Tasks will be **removed instantly** after pressing the remove button **without any warning/confirmation steps**.
- The app was developed and tested on **Android** only since I am not capable of working on iOS.
